 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The goal of this project is to create a soft robotic hand that mechanically
 * mimics a human hand as closely as possible and can actuate the thumb and 
 * pointer finger. The pointer finger and thumb will each require 4 motors to 
 * actuate the 4 tendons per finger and each motor will require its own motor 
 * driver. To control the fingers each tendon requires position and tension 
 * control thus each motor will use an encoder and a current sensor and closed
 *  loop position and impedance control. The user will specify the position of
 *  the thumb and index finger by selecting from a list of preprogrammed poses.

 * \subsection prints 3D Printed Components
 *
 * The mechanical design of the hand itself was completed prior to ME 507,
 * however the base was designed for ME 507. All of the components are 3D printed
 * to allow for rapid prototyping. The hand itself is printed out of 85A TPU
 * filament. The base and motor spools are printed out of standard PLA. 
 *
 * \subsection motor Motors and Tendons
 *
 * The tendons for each finger are made of high-strength braided fishing line
 * strung through channels printed into the hand. These tendons are spooled in and
 * out by N20 Gear Motors with a 298:1 Gear Ratio and an encoder. Each motor is
 * individually controlled allowing for multiple motors to be used in tandem to 
 * mimic the differential tension used to actuate a human hand.
