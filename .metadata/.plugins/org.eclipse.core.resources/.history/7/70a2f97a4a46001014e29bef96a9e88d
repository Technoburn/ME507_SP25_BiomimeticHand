/*! \mainpage Biomimetic Soft Robotic Hand
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The goal of this project is to create a soft robotic hand that mechanically
 * mimics a human hand as closely as possible and can actuate the thumb and 
 * pointer finger. The pointer finger and thumb will each require 4 motors to 
 * actuate the 4 tendons per finger and each motor will require its own motor 
 * driver. To control the fingers each tendon requires position and tension 
 * control thus each motor will use an encoder and a current sensor and closed
 *  loop position and impedance control. The user will specify the position of
 *  the thumb and index finger by selecting from a list of preprogrammed poses.
 *
 * \section mech_design Mechanical Design
 *
 * The mechanical design for this project was largely completed before ME 507 began,
 * with the hand itself having already been iterated on many times before the version
 * used in this project. As such the majority of the mechanical design during ME 507
 * was focused on the base and spools whcih was iterated on a few times to reach the
 * final design.

 * \subsection prints 3D Printed Components
 * All of the components are 3D printed to allow for rapid prototyping. 
 * The hand itself is printed out of 85A TPU to facilitate the flexible joints.
 * The base and motor spools are printed out of standard PLA for easy printing.
 *
 * \subsection motor Motors and Tendons
 *
 * The tendons for each finger are made of high-strength braided fishing line
 * strung through channels printed into the hand. These tendons are spooled in and
 * out by N20 Gear Motors with a 298:1 Gear Ratio and an encoder. These specific 
 * motors were selected, despite their cost, because there are very small form 
 * factor with exceptional maximum torque and adequate RPM. Each motor is
 * individually controlled allowing for multiple motors to be used in tandem to 
 * mimic the differential tension used to actuate a human hand.

 * \subsection mcu Microcontrollers
 *
 * The microcontrollers used for this project are STM32G473RB in the 64 pin QFP
 * package. These were selected because this project uses a significant number of
 * peripherals and GPIO and these microcontrollers are configurable for at least 5 
 * ADC channels, 5 DAC channels, 5 encoder timers, 5 pairs of PWM timers, ST-Link, 
 * I2C, UART, and GPIO at the same time.
