Introduction</h1>
<p>The goal of this project is to create a soft robotic hand that mechanically mimics a human hand as closely as possible and can actuate the thumb and pointer finger. The pointer finger and thumb will each require 4 motors to actuate the 4 tendons per finger and each motor will require its own motor driver. To control the fingers each tendon requires position and tension control thus each motor will use an encoder and a current sensor and closed loop position and impedance control. The user will specify the position of the thumb and index finger by selecting from a list of preprogrammed poses.</p>

Mechanical Design</h1>
<p>The mechanical design for this project was largely completed before ME 507 began, with the hand itself having already been iterated on many times before the version used in this project. As such the majority of the mechanical design during ME 507 was focused on the base and spools whcih was iterated on a few times to reach the final design.</p>

<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="prints"></a>
3D Printed Components</h2>
<p>All of the components are 3D printed to allow for rapid prototyping. The hand itself is printed out of 85A TPU to facilitate the flexible joints. The base and motor spools are printed out of standard PLA for easy printing.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="motor"></a>
Motors and Tendons</h2>
<p>The tendons for each finger are made of high-strength braided fishing line strung through channels printed into the hand. These tendons are spooled in and out by N20 Gear Motors with a 298:1 Gear Ratio and an encoder. These specific motors were selected, despite their cost, because there are very small form factor with exceptional maximum torque and adequate RPM. Each motor is individually controlled allowing for multiple motors to be used in tandem to mimic the differential tension used to actuate a human hand.</p>
<h1 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="elec_design"></a>
Electrical Design</h1>
<p>The electrical design for this project was broken down such that the same electronics can be used for each finger, significantly reducing the scope. Each finger is driven by one PCB which accepts a nominal 12V supply which is regulated to 5V and 3.3V for the encoders and microcontroller respectively. Each board can control up to 5 motors each with its own motor driver. With this seperation in mind each board also has its own microcontrollers which was intended to communicate with the other microcontrollers using I2C.</p>

Microcontrollers</h2>
<p>The microcontrollers used for this project are STM32G473RB in the 64 pin QFP package. These were selected because this project uses a significant number of peripherals and GPIO and these microcontrollers are configurable for at least 5 ADC channels, 5 DAC channels, 5 encoder timers, 5 pairs of PWM timers, ST-Link, I2C, UART, and GPIO at the same time.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="drv"></a>
Motor Drivers</h2>
<p>The motor drivers for this project are the Texas Instruments DRV886. These motor drivers were selected because they are more than capable of driving the N20 motors (12V and 1.6A stall), they also include features like integrated current sensing and cycle-by-cycle current regulation which when combined with the ADC and DAC of the microcontroller is useful for current control and dynamic current limiting.</p>
<h2 class="doxsection"><a class="anchor" id="wires"></a>
Wiring</h2>
<p>Both PCBs are supplied with 12V by connecting in parallel to a DC power supply. The motors and boards are connected together via wiring harnessed, the motors come with 6-pin ZH1.5 JST connectors and so those same connectors are used to extend the existing wires as necessary to connect the motors to the PCBs. The boards are connected together for I2C communication using a 3-pin ZH1.5 JST connector.</p>
